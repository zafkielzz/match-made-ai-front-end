✅ **Right:** "Junior developer with 1-2 years experience in Python and Django"

### 3. Vague Descriptions
❌ **Wrong:** "Work on various projects"
✅ **Right:** "Design and implement RESTful APIs for our mobile app backend"

### 4. Everything is "Required"
❌ **Wrong:** 20 required skills including nice-to-haves
✅ **Right:** 5-7 core required skills + separate preferred skills

### 5. Copy-Paste Tech Stack
❌ **Wrong:** Listing every technology your company uses
✅ **Right:** Only technologies this specific role will use

### 6. Hidden Information
❌ **Wrong:** "Competitive salary" with no range
✅ **Right:** "$80,000 - $120,000/year based on experience"
